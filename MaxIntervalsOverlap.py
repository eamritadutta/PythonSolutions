# Find the point where maximum intervals overlap
# Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is # maintained. Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party. Note # that entries in register are not in any order.

# Input: arrl[] = {1, 2, 10, 5, 5}
#        exit[] = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}

# First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4,
# second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.

# Output: 5
# There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.

# Just defining a function and getting on with it
